**Version 1.0.0**
### In this Repo we were provided a working INDEX.HTML with Style.CSS and a Script.js with very little code. I was tasked to create a Password Generator using only JAVASCRIPT. The requirements for the Password are as listed, Must be in between 8-128 characters in length, user is able to choose what type of characters to use. For example, lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers and special characters.I also was to make sure application alerts when inputs are incorrect and to try again.
